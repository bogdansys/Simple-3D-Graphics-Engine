# Simple-3D-Graphics-Engine

A rudimentary 3D graphics engine that projects and visualizes basic geometric shapes in a console environment.

## Overview

This project provides a simple way to visualize and understand the basic principles of 3D projection onto a 2D plane. It emphasizes the mathematical aspects of geometry and projection, making it a valuable tool for students and enthusiasts looking to delve into the world of 3D mathematics.

## Features

- **Geometric Shapes**: Includes a variety of shapes such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, and more.
- **Rotation**: Ability to rotate shapes to view them from different angles.
- **Projection**: Uses mathematical formulas to project 3D points onto a 2D plane.
- **Interactive Menu**: Allows users to choose which shape to visualize.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code.
2. Run the executable.
3. Use the interactive menu to select a shape.
4. Watch as the shape rotates and is projected onto your console screen.

## Limitations

This is a basic simulator and does not include advanced features found in professional 3D graphics engines such as texture mapping, advanced lighting, shaders, etc.

## Future Improvements

- Add more geometric shapes.
- Implement basic lighting models.
- Optimize rendering for smoother visuals.
